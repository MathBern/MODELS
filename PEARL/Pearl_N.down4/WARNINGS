 Max. cont. freq may be too small in in SET_X_FREQ_V2
 Max. cont. should generally be set to 1000 when X-rays present
 Need to allow for ionization from inner shells. Generally can
 ignore ionization from n=1 (=PQN) state of iron group elements
 since these can also ionize from n=2 sate. A list of effected
 ionization routes follows:

 Checking whether some low ionization stages may be omitted from the model.
 Checking whether some high ionization stages may be omitted from the model.
 Checking whether lower ionization stages need to be included in model
 
 Checking whether additional higher ionization stages  need to be included in the model.
 NB: If XzV needs to be included it will also be necessary to include XzIV, as this was
      only included as the ground state.
