 NB: If XzV needs to be included it will also be necessary to include XzIV, as this was
      only included as the ground state.

 Need to allow for ionization from inner shells. Generally can
 ignore ionization from n=1 (=PQN) state of iron group elements
 since these can also ionize from n=2 sate. A list of effected
 ionization routes follows:
