 Max. cont. freq may be too small in in SET_X_FREQ_V2
 Max. cont. should generally be set to 1000 when X-rays present
 Need to allow for ionization from inner shells. Generally can
 ignore ionization from n=1 (=PQN) state of iron group elements
 since these can also ionize from n=2 sate. A list of effected
 ionization routes follows:

  IZ=26    NE=24   PQN= 1   ANG= 0      Edge Freq(10^15 Hz)=  1.72E+03
  IZ=26    NE=23   PQN= 1   ANG= 0      Edge Freq(10^15 Hz)=  1.72E+03
  IZ=26    NE=22   PQN= 1   ANG= 0      Edge Freq(10^15 Hz)=  1.73E+03
